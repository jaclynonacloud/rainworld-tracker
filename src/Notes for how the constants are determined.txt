Talking about the game code for how the score is calculated... it works in a strange, strange way

In, StoryGameStatisticsScreen
Line 158 is where the kills are included

The values for the creatures are tied to the sandbox unlock symbols

Looking at MultiplayerUnlocks.SandboxUnlockForSymbolData
Can see the source of the bug for the centipede scores here...

From here, MultiplayerUnlocks.SandboxUnlockID is used with ParseEnum to do the rest.
CreatureTemplate.Type produces a string -> used as a key for MultiplayerUnlocks.SandboxUnlockID

It is done this way because Rain World developers...

Finally, SandboxSettingsInterface.DefaultKillScores has the scores
These are matched against the MultiplayerUnlocks and not the Creature types
